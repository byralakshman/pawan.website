        <p><h1>Jana Sena Party</h1>
        <h3>Kalyan founded a <b>political party</b> named Jana Sena Party on 14 March 2014.[57] He wrote a book titled Ism which is also the ideology of the Jana Sena party.[58]
             He met with then BJP Prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to discuss the issues related to both the Telugu states and extended his support.[59] 
             He campaigned extensively for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He opposed Congress party's rule stating the slogan Congress Hatao, 
             Desh Bachao (lit. 'Stop Congress, Save the Country' in Hindi).[60] His rallies drew what the Deccan-Journal called "huge crowds" in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[61] In August 2017,
              he announced that he intended to enter full-time politics starting October 2017 once he completes his film commitments.[62]</h3>
        
              <h3>Kalyan has announced the <i>Jana Sena party's</i> 2019 election manifesto at Rajahmundry[75] public meeting with many measures to improve the lives of farmers,[76] farm labourers, women, youth, and students.
               His party would contest together with left parties[77] Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), and Bahujan Samaj Party[78] for the upcoming 2019 elections in both Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. 
               At the same time, when he was actively campaigning for the elections all around Andhra Pradesh, he fell sick and shared a few health problems. As he was getting ready for his next round of campaign at Sattenapalle, he felt dizzy and nauseated.
               When the chopper was down for refilling at Gannavaram airport, he was down with vomiting, dehydration, and drowsiness. Immediately then, he was hospitalized and treated in Vijayawada. Again the campaign resumed after he got well.[79][80]

              The Jana Sena Party has contested 140 constituencies in the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections. Kalyan has contested two constituencies – Gajuwaka[81] and Bhimavaram.[82] He has lost in both to candidates from YSR Congress Party.[83] 
              His party was able to win from Razole, making it the only seat it has won in the election.[84]</h3>
